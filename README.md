# Instacart Data Analysis Project

Here you will find David's files for his Instacart project. Prepared data folder was too large to add.  Available upon request. Note that when David started this project, he was working with inferior hardware (4 gigs of ram). For much of the work, he needed to use an "ingenius" combination of Terality and Google Colab to perform the required operations. You may notice this when reviewing the scripts, but have no fear. David has since upgraded his equipment.
